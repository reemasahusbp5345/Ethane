Rohit is a doting husband and a loving father to a 2-year-old baby girl. 5 years ago, his father met with a horrible accident which left him paralysed and also caused memory loss. While their family was still processing the devastation, Rohit had suffered from a stroke. On 24 February 2020, Rohit suddenly collapsed and was rushed to the hospital. The doctor told his wife that he suffered from brain haemorrhage because of which he will have to be admitted to the hospital. He also told her that Rohit’s condition was critical and that he will have to stay in the hospital for a long time for treatment & recovery. Rohit is the sole earner of his family and unfortunately, he cannot afford to pay for his own treatment. They need Rs 50 Lakh more and you are their only hope.Please find it in your heart to pay however much you can for Rohit’s life-saving treatment so he can go back home healthy & happy. ",

Our educational system uses standardized methods that are ineffective in imparting knowledge and evaluating skills of differentially abled learners.As a nonprofit residential school committed to recognizing talent and skills among special needs students, we place the greatest emphasis on personalised instruction. Coupled with the great level of attention, care and support in a safe and secure environment, our children not just thrive but blossom.The confidence that we help them gain contributes to making them feel independent to live a full life in college and in their workplace. There is an untapped pool of future artists, entrepreneurs, innovators and leaders in this community.",
